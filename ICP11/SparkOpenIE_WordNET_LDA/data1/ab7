OBJECTIVES: To examine the possible neuroprotective and antiepileptic effects of metformin in a rat model of PTZ-induced epilepsy and its possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: forty male albino rats were allocated into 4 equal groups; 1) normal control (NC) group, 2) Metf group: metformin (200 mg/kg i.p. daily) for 2 weeks, 3) PTZ-group: received PTZ (50 mg/Kg, i.p. every other day) for 2 weeks and 4) Metf group: received PTZ and metformin (200 mg/kg i.p. daily) for 2 weeks. RESULTS: administration of PTZ caused significant increase in seizure score and duration with a state of oxidative stress (high MDA, low GSH and CAT) and upregulation of b-catenin, caspase-3 and its splitted products, Hsp70 and a-synuclein in hippocampal regions and significant reduction in seizure latency. While, Metf treatment ameliorated significantly PTZ-induced seizures, attenuated the oxidative stress and the upregulated a-synuclein and b-catenin expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation and the release of splitting product and caused more upregulation in Hsp70 expression in hippocampal regions (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Metf has antiepileptic and neuroprotective effects in PTZ-induced epilepsy which might be due to inhibition of apoptosis, attenuation of oxidative stress and a-synuclein expression and upregulation of Hsp70.
