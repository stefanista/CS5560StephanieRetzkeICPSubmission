BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among children with epilepsy. Lack of high-quality evidence led to variability among scientific societies recommendations. Therefore, we aim to determine the efficacy of different common doses used in the pediatric practice to maintain optimal 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 [OH] vitamin D) level in children with epilepsy and normal baseline 25 (OH) vitamin D level over 6 months of supplementation. METHODS: This is a protocol for phase IV pragmatic randomized superiority controlled open-label trial at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh. Children with epilepsy and receiving chronic antiepliptic medication and normal baseline 25 (OH) vitamin D level will be randomly assigned to receive Cholecalciferol 400IU/day versus 1000IU/day for 6 months. Our primary outcome is the proportion of children with vitamin D insufficiency (25 (OH) vitamin D level<75nmol/L) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include seizure treatment failure, seizure frequency, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, bone mineral density, and safety. DISCUSSION: Our trial is set out to evaluate the efficacy of common different vitamin D maintenance doses on 25 (OH) vitamin D level, seizure control, and bone health for children with epilepsy. The results of our study will possibly help in shaping current vitamin D guidelines for vitamin D supplementation in children with epilepsy and provide a link between 25 (OH) vitamin D level and seizure control.
