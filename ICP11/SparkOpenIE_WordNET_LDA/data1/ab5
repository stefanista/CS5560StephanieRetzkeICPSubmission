BACKGROUND: Patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome present with distinct facial anomalies and clinical features such as global developmental delay, recurrent respiratory infections, and epileptic seizures. Approximately half of all patients develop epileptic seizures which are refractory in most cases despite active medical management. Furthermore, no previous reports have discussed the efficacy of surgical treatment for seizures in patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome. CASE REPORT: In the present report, we describe a case of MECP2 duplication syndrome in a 15-year-old boy who developed epileptic seizures following influenza-associated acute encephalitis. His frequent epileptic spasms, tonic, atonic, and partial seizures were refractory to multiple antiepileptic medications. Electroencephalography revealed continuous diffuse epileptic discharge, resulting in regression. A total corpus callosotomy (CC) was performed at the age of 14   years and 7   months. His seizures markedly decreased following CC, although he continued to experience brief partial seizures approximately once per month. Post-operative examination revealed that his epileptic discharges had disappeared, and that his developmental state had returned to pre-encephalopathy levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that CC may represent a valuable surgical option for children with medically refractory generalized seizures following acute encephalopathy, irrespective of genetic disorders such as MECP2 duplication syndrome.
