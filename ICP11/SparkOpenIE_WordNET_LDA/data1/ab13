Background: In the surgical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy with mesial temporal lobe tumor, whether to remove the hippocampus aiming for a better seizure outcome in addition to removing the tumor is a dilemma. Two pediatric cases treated successfully with tumor removal alone are presented. Case Description: The first case was an 11-year-old girl with a ganglioglioma in the left uncus, and the second case was a 9-year-old girl with a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma in the left parahippocampal gyrus. In both cases, the hippocampus was not invaded, merely compressed by the tumor. Tumor removal was performed under intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) monitoring. After tumor removal, abnormal discharges remained at the hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortices, but further surgical interventions were not performed. The seizures disappeared completely in both cases. Conclusions: When we must decide whether to remove the hippocampus, the side of the lesion, the severity and chronicity of the seizures, and the presence of invasion to the hippocampus are the factors that should be considered. Abnormal discharges on ECoG at the hippocampus or adjacent cortices are one of the factors related to epileptogenicity, but it is simply a result of interictal irritation, and it is not an absolute indication for additional surgical intervention.
