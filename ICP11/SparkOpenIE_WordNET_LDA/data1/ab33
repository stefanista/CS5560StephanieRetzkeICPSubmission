Detection of epileptic seizure activities from long-term multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a significant role in the timely treatment of the patients with epilepsy. Visual identification of epileptic seizure in long-term EEG is cumbersome and tedious for neurologists, which might also lead to human error. Therefore, an automated tool for accurate detection of seizures in a long-term multi-channel EEG is essential for the clinical diagnosis. This study proposes an algorithm using multi-features and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) classifier. After appropriate approval from the ethical committee, recordings of EEG data were collected from the Institute of Neurosciences, Ramaiah Memorial College and Hospital, Bengaluru. Initially, preprocessing was performed to remove the power-line noise and motion artifacts. Four features, namely power spectral density (Yule-Walker), entropy (Shannon and Renyi), and Teager energy, were extracted. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and descriptive analysis ensure the suitability of the proposed features for pattern classification. Single and multi-features were fed to the MLPNN classifier to evaluate the performance of the study. The simulation results showed sensitivity, specificity, and false detection rate of 97.1%, 97.8%, and 1  h-1, respectively, using multi-features. Further, the results indicate the proposed study is suitable for real-time seizure recognition from multi-channel EEG recording. The graphical user interface was developed in MATLAB to provide an automated biomarker for normal and epileptic EEG signals.
