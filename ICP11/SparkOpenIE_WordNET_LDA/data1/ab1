The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone, on the severity of seizures and levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins in animals with kindling model induced by pentylenetetrazole (20   mg/kg) in alternated days for 15   days of treatment. The animals were divided into five groups: control group given saline, a group treated with diazepam (2   mg/kg) and groups treated with dexamethasone (1, 2 and 4   mg/kg). Open field test was conducted. The treatment with dexamethasone decreased the severity of seizures, also decreased TNF-alpha and Interleukin 1 beta levels in the hippocampus and TNF-alpha level in the serum.
