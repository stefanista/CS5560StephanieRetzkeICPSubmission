Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurologic disorders that affects individuals of all ages. It is primarily managed with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), with the goal of maintaining complete seizure control combined with minimal or no adverse effects. Oral administration is the mainstay of AED delivery for patients with chronic epilepsy and consists essentially of immediate-release (IR) and modified-release (delayed-release and extended-release [ER]) dosage formulations. Extended-release formulations (hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix systems, reservoir systems, and osmotic-release systems) release a drug in a controlled manner during an extended period of time following administration. Extended-release formulations have many advantages compared with IR formulations, including simplification of dosing regimens, reduction in pill burden, and reduction in the peak-to-trough fluctuations in serum drug concentration that may be associated with a decreased risk of adverse effects and of seizures. These advantages have the potential to increase adherence to antiepileptic therapy, improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce health care costs. This article, which is intended as a practical guide for clinicians, reviews the properties of the different ER AED formulations currently available and discusses the advantages of ER over IR formulations. Subsequently, an explanation of the technologic basis of the different oral ER formulations, the critical attributes that differentiate ER products, and their individual strengths and weaknesses is provided. Specific recommendations to practitioners on treating patients with ER formulations are included.
