BACKGROUND: Extended-release levetiracetam (LEV-XR) has gained acceptance as an antiepileptic drug in dogs. No studies have evaluated its disposition in dogs with epilepsy. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LEV-XR in epileptic dogs when administered alone or with phenobarbital or zonisamide. ANIMALS: Eighteen client-owned dogs on steady-state maintenance treatment with LEV-XR (Group L, n   =   6), LEV-XR and phenobarbital (Group LP, n   =   6), or LEV-XR and zonisamide (Group LZ, n   =   6). METHODS: Pharmacokinetic study. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12   hours after LEV-XR was administered with food. Plasma LEV concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A population pharmacokinetic approach and nonlinear mixed effects modeling were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Treatment group accounted for most of the interindividual variation. The LP group had lower CMAX (13.38    g/mL) compared to the L group (33.01    g/mL) and LZ group (34.13    g/mL), lower AUC (134.86 versus 352.95 and 452.76   hours   g/mL, respectively), and higher CL/F (0.17 versus 0.08 and 0.07   L/kg/hr, respectively). The half-life that defined the terminal slope of the plasma concentration versus time curve (~5 hours) was similar to values previously reported for healthy dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Considerable variation exists in the pharmacokinetics of LEV-XR in dogs with epilepsy being treated with a common dose regimen. Concurrent administration of phenobarbital contributed significantly to the variation. Other factors evaluated, including co-administration of zonisamide, were not shown to contribute to the variability. Drug monitoring may be beneficial to determine the most appropriate dose of LEV-XR in individual dogs.
