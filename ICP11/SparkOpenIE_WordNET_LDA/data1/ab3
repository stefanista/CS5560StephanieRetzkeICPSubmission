PURPOSE: The aim of this trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of two formulations of levetiracetam in people with partial epilepsy over a 12-week treatment period. METHODS: We performed a randomized, paralleled, and multicenter trial that consisted of a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in, followed by a 12-week double-blind, double-dummy treatment phase to compare the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam extended-release (LEV-ER) and immediate-release (LEV-IR) tablets as an adjunctive treatment in adult patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. RESULTS: The median partial-onset seizure (POS) frequency per week (min-max) was 0.3 (0.0, 17.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3, 4.8) in the LEV-ER group and 0.3 (0.0, 31.4; 95% CI   -   0.1, 4.3) in the LEV-IR group. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial period. Both groups had the same responder rate (58.6%), while a higher rate of seizure freedom over the treatment period was noted in the LEV-ER group compared with the LEV-IR group (27.6% vs. 13.8%, respectively). The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scores significantly increased in the LEV-ER-treated group, in contrast to the scores in the LEV-IR group, which decreased (7.2 vs.   -   1.5, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LEV-ER is equivalent to LEV-IR in reducing the frequency of POS and has a similar tolerability as LEV-IR as an add-on therapy. In addition, LEV-ER treatment improved the health-related quality of life of people with uncontrolled partial epilepsy.
