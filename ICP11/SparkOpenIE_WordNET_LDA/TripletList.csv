METHODS: We performed a randomized  paralleled  and multicenter trial that consisted of a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in  followed by a 12-week double-blind  double-dummy treatment phase to compare the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam extended-release (LEV-ER) and immediate-release (LEV-IR) tablets as an adjunctive treatment in adult patients with uncontrolled epilepsy.,We;performed;paralleled|adult patients;is with;uncontrolled epilepsy|adjunctive treatment;is in;adult patients with uncontrolled epilepsy|We;performed;randomized paralleled|,4
RESULTS: The median partial-onset seizure (POS) frequency per week (min-max) was 0.3 (0.0  17.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3  4.8) in the LEV-ER group and 0.3 (0.0  31.4; 95% CI   -   0.1  4.3) in the LEV-IR group.,,0
No serious adverse events occurred during the trial period.,,0
Both groups had the same responder rate (58.6%)  while a higher rate of seizure freedom over the treatment period was noted in the LEV-ER group compared with the LEV-IR group (27.6% vs. 13.8%  respectively).,higher rate;was;noted|groups;had responder rate;noted|rate;was noted compared with;LEV-IR group|groups;had responder rate;noted in LEV-ER group|higher rate;was noted in;LEV-ER group|groups;had;same responder rate|groups;had;responder rate|higher rate;was noted compared with;LEV-IR group|rate;was noted in;LEV-ER group|rate;was;noted|,10
The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scores significantly increased in the LEV-ER-treated group  in contrast to the scores in the LEV-IR group  which decreased (7.2 vs.   -   1.5  p = 0.03).,European Quality;significantly increased in;LEV-ER-treated group|Quality;increased in;LEV-ER-treated group|Quality;significantly increased in;contrast|European Quality;increased in;LEV-ER-treated group|European Quality;increased in;contrast|European Quality;increased in;group|Quality;increased in;group|Quality;increased in;contrast|European Quality;significantly increased in;group|European Quality;significantly increased in;contrast|Quality;significantly increased in;LEV-ER-treated group|scores;is in;LEV-IR group|Quality;significantly increased in;group|,13

METHODS: forty male albino rats were allocated into 4 equal groups; 1) normal control (NC) group  2) Metf group: metformin (200 mg/kg i.p. daily) for 2 weeks  3) PTZ-group: received PTZ (50 mg/Kg  i.p. every other day) for 2 weeks and 4) Metf group: received PTZ and metformin (200 mg/kg i.p. daily) for 2 weeks.,2 weeks;for metformin is;200 mg/kg i.p. daily|,1
RESULTS: administration of PTZ caused significant increase in seizure score and duration with a state of oxidative stress (high MDA  low GSH and CAT) and upregulation of b-catenin  caspase-3 and its splitted products  Hsp70 and a-synuclein in hippocampal regions and significant reduction in seizure latency.,duration;is with;state of oxidative stress|administration;duration with;state of oxidative stress|increase;is in;seizure score|administration;caused;significant increase|administration;caused;increase in seizure score|its products Hsp70;upregulation;a-synuclein|its products Hsp70;duration with;state of oxidative stress|its splitted products Hsp70;upregulation;a-synuclein|its splitted products Hsp70;upregulation of;b-catenin caspase-3|its products Hsp70;duration with;state|administration;significant increase in;seizure score|its products Hsp70;administration of;PTZ|its splitted products Hsp70;administration of;PTZ|significant reduction;is in;seizure latency|administration;increase in;seizure score|administration;duration with;state of stress|its products Hsp70;significant increase in;seizure score|its products Hsp70;upregulation of;b-catenin caspase-3|its products Hsp70;increase in;seizure score|its products Hsp70;increase;a-synuclein|administration;caused;duration with state|its products Hsp70;duration;a-synuclein|administration;duration with;state|administration;upregulation of;b-catenin caspase-3|its splitted products Hsp70;is in;hippocampal regions|its products Hsp70;significant increase;a-synuclein|its splitted products Hsp70;administration;a-synuclein|administration;caused;duration with state of stress|administration;caused;increase|its products Hsp70;administration;a-synuclein|its products Hsp70;duration with;state of stress|administration;caused;significant increase in seizure score|administration;caused;duration|,33
While  Metf treatment ameliorated significantly PTZ-induced seizures  attenuated the oxidative stress and the upregulated a-synuclein and b-catenin expression  inhibited caspase-3 activation and the release of splitting product and caused more upregulation in Hsp70 expression in hippocampal regions (p< 0.05).,seizures;attenuated;stress|more upregulation;is in;Hsp70 expression|b-catenin;inhibited;release of splitting product|upregulated a-synuclein;inhibited;release of splitting product|PTZ-induced seizures;attenuated stress;Metf treatment ameliorated|b-catenin;release of;splitting product|b-catenin;inhibited;release|PTZ-induced seizures;attenuated;oxidative stress|Hsp70 expression;is in;hippocampal regions|PTZ-induced seizures;attenuated;stress|seizures;attenuated stress;Metf treatment ameliorated|upregulated a-synuclein;inhibited;release|b-catenin;inhibited;caspase-3 activation|a-synuclein;inhibited;release of splitting product|upregulated a-synuclein;inhibited;caspase-3 activation|a-synuclein;inhibited;release|seizures;attenuated;oxidative stress|a-synuclein;inhibited;caspase-3 activation|,18
CONCLUSION: Metf has antiepileptic and neuroprotective effects in PTZ-induced epilepsy which might be due to inhibition of apoptosis  attenuation of oxidative stress and a-synuclein expression and upregulation of Hsp70.,,0

Conclusions: When we must decide whether to remove the hippocampus  the side of the lesion  the severity and chronicity of the seizures  and the presence of invasion to the hippocampus are the factors that should be considered.,,0
Abnormal discharges on ECoG at the hippocampus or adjacent cortices are one of the factors related to epileptogenicity  but it is simply a result of interictal irritation  and it is not an absolute indication for additional surgical intervention.,,0

Results: Most frequently  the pathological foci were located in frontal and parietal lobes nearby eloquent brain areas.,Results;located in;frontal lobes|,1
Irrespective of damage location  simple partial and complex partial seizures were seen almost with the same frequency.,,0
Intraoperative mapping of eloquent cortical areas and subcortical tracts without sedation resulted in total resection of pathological area in 75% of cases with low rate of permanent neurological deficit (two patients).,cases;is with;low rate of permanent neurological deficit|mapping;resulted in;resection of pathological area|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;resection of area|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;resection of pathological area|mapping;resulted in;75 %|cases;of % is;two patients|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;total resection of area|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;total resection of pathological area|mapping;resulted in;resection|mapping;resulted in;total resection of area|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;resection|mapping;resulted in;total resection|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;75 %|Intraoperative mapping;resulted in;total resection|mapping;resulted in;total resection of pathological area|mapping;resulted in;resection of area|,16

Here  we explore the possibility of a diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) playing a role in regulating the effect of VPA relating to the treatment of both disorders  using the biomedical model Dictyostelium discoideum DGK enzymes provide the first step in the phosphoinositide recycling pathway  implicated in seizure activity.,first step;is in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway implicated|provide;step in;recycling pathway|provide;first step in;recycling pathway implicated|we;explore;possibility|provide;step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway|possibility;using;biomedical model Dictyostelium discoideum DGK enzymes|possibility;using;model Dictyostelium discoideum DGK enzymes|provide;step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway implicated|provide;first step in;recycling pathway implicated in seizure activity|provide;step in;recycling pathway implicated|provide;step in;recycling pathway implicated in seizure activity|we;Here explore;possibility|provide;first step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway implicated|provide;step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway implicated in seizure activity|provide;first step in;recycling pathway|provide;first step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway|provide;first step in;phosphoinositide recycling pathway implicated in seizure activity|we;explore;possibility of diacylglycerol kinase|we;Here explore;possibility of diacylglycerol kinase|,19

To differentiate a potential role for this DGKA-dependent mechanism in epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatment  we further show that the dgkA null mutant is resistant to the developmental effects of a range of structurally distinct branched medium-chain fatty acids with seizure control activity and to the bipolar disorder treatment lithium.,dgkA mutant;is;resistant to effects with seizure control activity to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to effects to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;effects with seizure control activity|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects with seizure control activity to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;developmental effects|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to effects to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;effects|dgkA mutant;is;resistant|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to effects to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;developmental effects with seizure control activity|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to effects with seizure control activity to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;effects with seizure control activity|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;developmental effects|developmental effects;is with;seizure control activity|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to effects to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to effects with seizure control activity to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects with seizure control activity to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects with seizure control activity to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects with seizure control activity to disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to effects with seizure control activity to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|potential role;is in;epilepsy|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;bipolar disorder treatment lithium|dgkA null mutant;is resistant to;developmental effects with seizure control activity|dgkA mutant;is resistant to;effects|dgkA null mutant;is;resistant to developmental effects to bipolar disorder treatment lithium|,32
Finally  we show that VPA  lithium and novel epilepsy treatments function through DAG regulation  and the presence of DGKA is necessary for compound-specific increases in DAG levels following treatment.,epilepsy treatments;function through;DAG regulation|presence;is necessary for;increases in DAG levels following treatment|presence;is necessary for;compound-specific increases in DAG levels|compound-specific increases;is in;DAG levels|presence;is necessary for;compound-specific increases|novel epilepsy treatments;function through;DAG regulation|presence;is necessary for;increases in DAG levels|presence;is necessary for;compound-specific increases in DAG levels following treatment|presence;is;necessary|VPA lithium;function through;DAG regulation|presence;is necessary for;compound-specific increases following treatment|presence;is necessary for;increases following treatment|presence;is necessary for;increases|,13
Thus  these experiments suggest that  in Dictyostelium  loss of DGKA attenuates a common cellular effect of VPA relating to both epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatments  and that a range of new compounds with this effect should be investigated as alternative therapeutic agents.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.,range;is with;effect|compounds;be;should investigated as agents.This article|compounds;be;should investigated|new compounds;be;should investigated|new compounds;be;should investigated as alternative therapeutic agents.This article|associated First Person interview;is with;first author of paper|new compounds;be;should investigated as therapeutic agents.This article|compounds;be;should investigated as alternative therapeutic agents.This article|compounds;be;should investigated as therapeutic agents.This article|new compounds;be;should investigated as alternative agents.This article|new compounds;be;should investigated as agents.This article|compounds;be;should investigated as alternative agents.This article|,12

In the subgroup of patients with IDD  the analysis was performed again and the number of background AEDs was the only predictor for the retention rate of lacosamide (P=0.04).,analysis;was performed In;subgroup of patients|background AEDs;number of was;predictor for retention rate of lacosamide|number;was predictor for;retention rate of lacosamide|number;was;predictor|patients;is with;IDD|background AEDs;number of was;predictor|analysis;was performed again In;subgroup of patients with IDD|analysis;was performed In;subgroup|background AEDs;number of was;only predictor for retention rate of lacosamide|analysis;was performed again In;subgroup of patients|background AEDs;number of was;predictor for retention rate|analysis;was;performed again|background AEDs;number of was;only predictor for retention rate|number;was;only predictor|analysis;was performed again In;subgroup|number;was only predictor for;retention rate|background AEDs;number of was;only predictor|number;was predictor for;retention rate|analysis;was;performed|analysis;was performed In;subgroup of patients with IDD|number;was only predictor for;retention rate of lacosamide|,21
Conclusion: When compared to patients without IDD  retention rates of lacosamide adjunctive therapy were lower in patients with IDD.,patients;is with;IDD|,1

There was no significant difference in seizure control between SeAH and ATL (P=0.760).,,0
The postoperative verbal IQ of SeAH group increased significantly in both side surgery (P<0.05)  while the increase was not significant in the group of ATL of both side surgery (P>0.05).,,0
Regarding left-side surgery  postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the group of SeAH (P<0.05)  while the increases were not significant in the group of ATL (P>0.05).,,0
In the right-side surgery  postoperative verbal memory and total memory were increased significantly in the two surgery strategy groups (P<0.05)  while no significant increases were seen in non-verbal memory of the two surgery strategy groups (P>0.05).,,0
Conclusion: Microsurgery for the treatment of refractory MTLE is successful and safe  and should be encouraged.,Microsurgery;be;encouraged|,1
The seizure outcome is not different between ATL and SeAH  while regarding as verbal IQ and verbal memory outcomes  SeAH may be superior to ATL in dominant hemisphere surgery.,ATL;is in;dominant hemisphere surgery|,1

RESULTS: One pathway matched the timeline in the AES guideline; nine pathways described more rapid timings.,nine pathways;described;more rapid timings|nine pathways;described;timings|nine pathways;described;rapid timings|pathways;described;timings|pathways;described;rapid timings|pathways;described;more rapid timings|,6
All pathways matched the guideline's stabilization phase in timing and five suggested that first-line benzodiazepine (BZD) be administered within this period.,first-line benzodiazepine;be;administered|guideline;has;phase|pathways;matched;five|benzodiazepine;be;administered|pathways;matched;guideline 's stabilization phase in timing|phase;is in;timing|benzodiazepine;be administered within;period|pathways;matched;guideline 's stabilization phase|first-line benzodiazepine;be administered within;period|,9
For second-line therapy timing (initiation of a non-BZD antiepileptic drug within 20 to 40 minutes)  one pathway matched the guideline; nine initiated the antiepileptic drug earlier (median 10 [range five to 15] minutes).,nine;initiated earlier;drug|nine;initiated earlier;antiepileptic drug|nine;initiated;antiepileptic drug|nine;initiated;drug|,4
Third-line therapy timings matched the AES guideline (40 minutes) in two pathways; eight suggested earlier timing (median 20 [range 15 to 30] minutes).,eight;suggested;timing|eight;suggested;earlier timing|,2
The first-line BZD recommended in all hospitals was intravenous lorazepam; alternatives included intramuscular midazolam or rectal diazepam.,alternatives;included;midazolam|alternatives;included;intramuscular midazolam|BZD;recommended in;hospitals|alternatives;included;rectal diazepam|alternatives;included;diazepam|first-line BZD;recommended in;hospitals|,6
In second-line therapy  nine pathways recommended fosphenytoin.,second-line therapy nine pathways;recommended;fosphenytoin|therapy nine pathways;recommended;fosphenytoin|,2
For third-line therapy  eight pathways recommended additional boluses of second-line medications; most commonly phenobarbital.,,0
Two pathways suggested escalation to third-line medication; most commonly midazolam.,,0
We found variance in dosing for the following medications: midazolam as first-line therapy  fosphenytoin  and levetiracetam as second-line therapy  and phenobarbital as third-line therapy medications.,We;found;variance|variance;is in;dosing|We;found;variance for following medications|We;found;variance in dosing for medications|We;found;variance in dosing|We;found;variance in dosing for following medications|We;found;variance for medications|,7
CONCLUSIONS: The pSERG hospitals status epilepticus pathways are consistent with the AES status epilepticus guideline in regard to the choice of medications  but generally recommend more rapid escalation in therapy than the guideline.,AES status epilepticus guideline;is in;regard to choice of medications|pSERG hospitals status epilepticus pathways;generally recommend;more rapid escalation in therapy than guideline|,2
